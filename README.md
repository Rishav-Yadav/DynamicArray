# DynamicArray
It is  a class that allows you to enter/create a dynamic Array and enter elements without worrying about the size.
It is a dynamic array and we do not have to specify the size while creating it, the size of the array automatically increases when we dynamically add and remove items. The following is a very basic idea explaining the working of the array when the array becomes full and if we try to add an item:

1.Creates a bigger-sized memory on heap memory (for example memory of double size).
2.Copies the current memory elements to the new memory.
3.New item is added now as there is bigger memory available now.
